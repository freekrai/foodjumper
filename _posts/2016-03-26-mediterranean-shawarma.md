steps:
  - Place a frying pan on your stove and turn it on to warm up.
  - In a blender, combine the yogurt, oil, the lemon juice, and the garlic.
  - Once they’re well combined, mix the grated cucumber and most of the dill into the mixture by hand – that’s your Tzatiki.
  - Season and cook the steaks – heating each side for upwards of 3 minutes depending on how well done you’d like it to be.
  - Let the steaks sit a little while, then spread the Tzatiki on the breads, place each steak on top of the bread, top with a few slices of tomato and  red onion and sprinkle the remaining dill on top. Enjoy  - Add steaks to plates after they are finished cooking, add carrots, pour over remaining marinade from the pan onto the plates, add any sides, and garnish with parsley if wanted.

Shawarma is one of my favourite foods, but there is a lack of good places to get decent shawarma around here so I make my own.
