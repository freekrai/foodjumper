steps:
  - Stir together the olive oil, apple cider, soy sauce, ground ginger, and garlic powder into the mixing bowl.
  - With a fork, stab the sirloin steak several times on both sides to puncture the fibres of the meat for marinating.
  - Insert the steak into the bag and pour in the marinade.  Shake the bag repeatedly to allow the marinade to coat the steak.
  - Put the bag into your refrigerator and wait 20-30 minutes to allow steak to marinade.
  - Add a little bit of oil to your pan or skillet ("pan") and set the burner to medium.
  - Pour the bag marinade and steaks into the pan and also add in the carrots.
  - Cover pan and bring to simmer/boil for ~10 minutes.  Depending on your type of burner and temperature setting, cooking times may vary.  Check your steak after it is browned with a knife and fork to ensure it is thoroughly cooked.  You can also check the carrots this way too; the carrots should cut easily.
  - Add steaks to plates after they are finished cooking, add carrots, pour over remaining marinade from the pan onto the plates, add any sides, and garnish with parsley if wanted.
