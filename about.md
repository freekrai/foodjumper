Foodjumper.com is an open source food site.

It is a place for foodies to find food they wan or crave and learn how to make it, and also to share how it's made.

If you want to share food, then all you have to do is [open an issue](https://github.com/freekrai/foodjumper/issues/new) in the foodjumper repo, with info about how to make the recipe, any images, etc and we'll post it on here for everyone to share.
